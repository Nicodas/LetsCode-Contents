# Topics for a code challenge

The best way to improve (y)our programming skills is to practice. Therefore, the idea is to start a common project where each of you/us will be in charge of parts of the code and will need to interact with others, so as to make sure the whole thing works.

First steps is to come up with some ideas. Feel free to post any kind of ideas that comes to your mind and to contribute directly in this file without erasing the proposals of your fellow developers. In my opinion, it should be achievable within 15-20 weeks or so... and it needs to be evolutive, i.e. we may want to add further features once we started coding. We may even combine multiple ideas within a single project.

Once we have chosen a project, I will be able to choose the contents of our weekly sessions with a focus on the features that we need to work on.


## List of ideas (with a short description)

1. Build an interactive map of Paris with cycle paths. 
1. Build an interactive map of Paris with street lights. Target would be to get an overview of the current infrastructure and estimate costs for a time period using power price curves.
